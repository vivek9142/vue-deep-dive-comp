/*
BadgeList and UserInfo have in common and that's the section
but actually not just a section but the section and the styling that's being applied
to that section. You might remember in the last lecture,
I copied the styling to ensure that the section has the same style
in both components.

an alternative would have been to simply make section a global style
here in App.vue where the style is not scoped but another alternative would be
to create a standalone component which simply contains the section
with the attached styling and which then is flexible
regarding the content it receives. 

I'm naming it like this because I want to create a certain look which is sometimes referred 
to as a Card Look in the web.Basically this look of having a drop shadow and rounded corners,
